        <p>This project is designed to be a program and/or integrated web extension that inputs a URL and
outputs a probability that the inputted URL is a phishing scam. From a user point of view, all that
occurs is a simple URL input, or in the case of a browser extension, a click of a button. The output is
the reliability score of the website in question. The project uses machine learning to predict if a
website is a phishing scam or not.</p>

    <p>This project will mainly use Python, as it has many packages and libraries used for data science and
machine learning. Models such as K—nearest neighbor, decision trees, naïve bayes, and support
vector machines will be used for classification. XGBoost, polyfit, and linregress will be used for
regression, with regplot from seaborn will be used to visualize data. These models can be obtained
from NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn packages freely available using pip.
Python3 will be used for the actual data preprocessing, model training, model testing, and model
evaluation. To implement a web extension, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS will be used. This will create
a simple interface that detects the current web URL, passes it through the ML model, and outputs a
classification and regression value indicating the reliability of the website in question. HTML and
CSS will be used to build and style the extension, while JavaScript will simply deal with user
interaction.</p>

       <a href="https://github.com/shreyagopal/Phishing-Website-Detection-by-Machine-Learning-Techniques/">Link to the proof of concept</a>
   
       <p>This project on GitHub employs similar techniques to build a ML model to determine if a website is
likely a phishing scam. Similar to what I would like to employ, it uses known phishing URLs and
known legitimate URLs to train a ML model (in this case, it employs multiple models and compares
their accuracy) and ultimately predict (classify) a URL's reliability. The features extracted from the 
URLs are similar to what I would like to employ, such as features of the actual URL, features of the
domain, and HTML/javascript features. I would like to create my own project rather than further
developing this one, because it is trained off of data that is 2+ years old, it also may have out-of-date
learning models which could be optimized with state of the art techniques, and it lacks the ability to
perform tasks live while in a browser. This project also uses classification, a subset of supervised
learning, while I would like to employ regression techniques.</p>

    <p>This tool will check URLs for domain squatting-- which is when a common website is registered
under a different domain (ex: registering apple.io vs apple.com), URL hijacking-- which takes
common website domain typos and registers them to make a website appear to be legitimate (ex:
goggle.com vs google.com), also checking other details in the URL such as its length, the number of
subdomains in the URL, and the Top-Level Domain (TLD). The project will also check the domain
name and its IP address to see if it is blacklisted in any commonly known phishing databases (ex:
https:openphish.com/phishing_database.html). Page-based features will be checked to determine
how reliable the website seems, websites (ex: PageRank and AWS) can be used for reference data.
Finally, content-based features can parse through the code used to develop the website and detect
the reliability of said website. All these features combined will use a decision-tree ML algorithm to
create a score that assesses the likelihood that a given URL is a phishing scam or not. While other
projects exist that use similar ideologies, this project will employ updated models and will use newly
updated data to train these models. With all of the different features used to create a predicted
output, this project has potential to be more accurate than similar projects.<br><br></p>

    <p>For people browsing the internet who want to be safe when clicking a link, PhishTales is a
website or browser extension that helps determine if a website is phishing.
Unlike Phishing Website Detection by Machine Learning Techniques, our product uses newer
website data and machine learning techniques.</p>

            This is the UML Class diagram for PhishTales. The beginning of the diagram shows
how the machine learning model is built from the dataset. The data is split into a training and
testing set, then pre-processed, followed by feature extraction and training/evaluation. This
requires the use of a number of python packages. After the model is complete, it is exported
using pickle to become a .pkl file. This pickle file is implemented into a python driver program
which predicts new outcomes based on a URL input. The driver program also takes input from a
user and checks its validity, extracts the features from the URL, and outputs the prediction from
the mode. From here, this program is implemented into a flask web application which allows a
user to use the model on the web to receive a result.

           In this sequence diagram, the user navigates to a potential phishing website, which
the extension listens to from a browser event. When the navigation request is received by the
extension, the extension sends a GET request to the ML Model Server. The ML Model server
then runs the Python script for the ML model with the URL as an argument. The ML Model
returns that the URL is potentially phishing, which the server then returns back to the extension.
The extension changes the tab to the blocke.html webpage, which is a webpage inside the
extension. The browser displays this to the user, giving them a message that the website is
potentially phishing and that they must click Go back to go to their previous website or continue
to the potential phishing website. The user clicks continue, and the blocked webpage sends a
request to the extension to ignore all navigation requests for the specified URL. The blocked
page then sends a request to the browser to navigate to the potential phishing URL. The
browser displays the website to the user.

        In this sequence diagram, the user enters a URL in the website and then the website
sends a GET request to the server with the URL. The Server then runs the Python script for the
ML model with the URL and gets the result that the URL is most likely phishing. The Server
returns that to the website, then the website returns a textbox to the user that the URL is most
likely phishing.
